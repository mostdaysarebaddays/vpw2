# VPW2 - a romhack

VPW2 - English of sorts. My idea of what an English release would've been if copyright laws didn't exist or they got licenses.

Patch to a clean VPW2 in .z64 format using whatever xdelta patcher you like.

Changes to battle royale, base game costumes, language and a few other things - try and find them!

Please report any issues to me at https://discordapp.com/users/reyyesrey.

Huge thanks to freem for VPWStudio, his translation and countless other things - this literally would not have been possible without him.

Thanks to krayzie2k99 for both creating move animations and letting me use them.

Thanks to Adz_FullMETAL for both creating textures and letting me use them.

Thanks to ragdas, SKStyles, Mongo, Ligerbusa, HIW, KKD, RetroRandy, Melonbread, yeelord and a million more over the years who kept me caring about this stuff.

AKI never die.



Note: if your names seem messed up when trying the standard patch coming from a previous version, use the 'vpw2 -savemessedup.xdelta' patch.
